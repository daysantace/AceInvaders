system_text_telemetry,Ace Invaders collects data about your system's hardware. You can change your decision later in Settings. No personal data is collected.
system_text_gachalock,Gacha is a highly addictive game mechanic. You are limited to ten gacha a day. You can view your cannons at any time.

system_text_gsettings_reflection,Enables/disables reflections. Reflections are typically the most GPU-intensive event, so disabling can help performance.
system_text_gsettings_glow,Enables/disables a soft glow around certain objects.
system_text_gsettings_flscr,Toggles whether Ace Invaders is windowed or in fullscreen.
system_text_gsettings_fps,Shows the average FPS.

system_text_psettings_multithread,Allows Ace Invaders to utilise multiple threads. This typically increases performance, but can be very laggy for Ace Invaders and the operating system, especially on single or dual-core systems.
system_text_psettings_load,Configures whether to put processing load onto the CPU or GPU. Can help if you experience a lot of lag or have poor components.
