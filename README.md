# Ace Invaders
A ridiculous game about shooting things as other things.<br>
Pre-Alpha v1.1 in development<br>

## Building
As of present, we do not have a license for GameMaker Studio 2.<br>
To compile and build the current versions of Ace Invaders, you must install GameMaker Studio 2.<br>
Download one of the `.yyz` files (or the current source code) and open with GameMaker Studio 2.<br>
The project should open. You can press the "run" button, or press F5 on your keyboard.<br>
Ace Invaders should compile. If you encounter a runtime error or bug while playing, refer to the "I've spotted a bug!" in this README.
### For Linux users
Unfortunately, GameMaker Studio 2 does not exist for Linux. Wine cannot run GameMaker Studio 2, so you will need a virtual machine running Windows to compile.<br>
YoYo Games is developing a port for Debian (incl. Debian based distros, such as Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, and Mint). It is still in beta, and cannot compile Ace Invaders (tested on Mint 21 Xfce).
## Contribution
Because Ace Invaders is an open-source game, you may contribute to it. What you need to contribute to it is:
#### Git
[**Install (GitHub Desktop)**](https://desktop.github.com/) | [**(Git Bash)**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)<br>
You can use any Git application, but we reccommend either GitHub Desktop or Git Bash for their ease of use.<br>
Git is the source control management software for GitHub, and thus Ace Invaders. To be able to pull Ace Invaders to your computer and push it back to GitHub, you must use Git.<br>
**Do not use GameMaker Studio 2's built-in source control!**

#### GameMaker Studio 2
[**Install**](https://accounts.yoyogames.com/downloads)
GameMaker Studio 2 is the software that is used to develop Ace Invaders.<br>
Please note you will need a YoYo Games account to download it.<br>
<br>
We currently accept any ideas into Ace Invaders. If you have an idea, you can add it in!<br>
Please pull the repo to your PC first before making edits locally, and then push to the main repo once done.<br>
If a merge conflict rises, please independently resolve it with the branch you wish to merge to. If the two branches cannot be resolved properly, the older branch will take priority.<br>

### OK, but how do I pull the repo to my computer?
There's quite a few ways, and the README cannot cover all of them.<br>
Here's some resources depending on your Git application.<br>
[**GitHub Desktop**](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)<br>
[**Git Bash**](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone)<br>
If your program is not listed, you can search the web for it.

### For Linux users
Neither GitHub Desktop or GameMaker Studio 2 are avaliable for Linux as of writing.<br>
As mentioned above, there is a beta version of GameMaker Studio 2 for Debian based distros. However, it cannot compile Ace Invaders, so you need a virtual machine running Windows.<br>
There is an unofficial port for GitHub Desktop, but it is not officially supported. You should use another Git application like Git Bash.
### Contributing
There are a few things you can do to contribute to Ace Invaders.

#### I just want to translate.
You can edit the `.csv` file containing all the translations. Download it, edit it, and then push it back to here.<br>
File path is `(working dir)/AceInvaders/datafiles/localisation.csv`. Do not change the `.ttf`, it's a font.<br>
Please open the file in a plaintext editor. It seems to break down in fancy editors like Excel. Google Sheets seems to work, however, but the process to open the `.csv` is slower than just opening it in Notepad (or your preferred plaintext editor)

#### I can do art. How can I help?
Like with translation, you don't need to necessarily know how to program to contribute to Ace Invaders.<br>
You can simply draw pixel art in your pixel art program of choice.<br>
**Please use the colour palette!** If you need it, daysant will provide it for you.<br>
If you do not use it, your art will have their colours reduced down to it.

#### I can program for the game.
Of course, programming is the main work required in Ace Invaders.<br>
Programming help would be greatly appreciated.<br>
Ace Invaders is developed in GameMaker Language. Use that for programming.<br>

#### Need music?
Music composition and SFX are needed for the auditory section of a game.
Composing music is another way you can contribute.<br>
Please remember that this is a "retro" game, so please use chiptune music (such as the buzzing noises in older (~ <1990) games)

#### I can't do any of these, but I still want to help.
If you can't do any of these, there are few things you can do.<br>
Many people do not realise it, but sharing a game is extremely helpful, especially in indie titles like Ace Invaders.<br>
Spread the word of this if you can!<br>
<br>
If you can do a mix of these, that would also be helpful to development, but no pressure.

### I've spotted a bug!
We allow you to report and fix bugs using the Issues tab on our GitHub page.<br>
Please mark all issues with "unevaluated" when submitting your report, otherwise it will be reported as invalid.<br>
Note that all issues cannot be fixed in an update, but we will try our best to fix them.
