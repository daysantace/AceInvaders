# Ace Invaders
a ridiculous game about shooting things as other things

## Contribution
Because Ace Invaders is an open-source game, you may contribute to it. What you need to contribute to it is:

> GameMaker Studio 2 (version 2.3.3+)<br>
> A browser<br>

We currently accept any ideas into Ace Invaders. If you have an idea, you can add it in!<br>
Please pull the repo to your PC first before making edits locally, and then push to the main repo once done.<br>
If a merge conflict rises, please independently resolve it with the branch you wish to merge to. If the two branches cannot be resolved properly, the older branch will take priority.<br>

### OK, but how do I pull the repo to my computer?
Google it. Internet has been out for 30 years, give or take. <br>

### I just want to translate.
You can edit the `.csv` file containing all the translations, download it, edit it, and then push it back to here.<br>
File path is `(working dir)/AceInvaders/datafiles/localisation.csv`. Do not change the `.ttf`, it's a font.<br>
Please open the file in a plaintext editor. It seems to break down in fancy editors like Excel. Google Sheets seems to work, however, but the process to open the `.csv` is slower than just opening it in Notepad (or your preferred plaintext editor)

## Bug reporting
We allow you to report and fix bugs using the Issues tab on our GitHub page.<br>
Please mark all issues with "unevaluated" when submitting your report, otherwise it will be reported as invalid.
